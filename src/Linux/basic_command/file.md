- `ln`

:::info{title="相关信息"}
ln命令是Linux系统中的一个非常重要的命令，它的功能是为某一个文件在另外一个位置建立一个同步的链接。当我们需要在不同的目录，用到相同的文件时，我们不需要在每一个需要的目录下都放一个必须相同的文件，我们只要在某个固定的目录，放上该文件，然后在其他的目录下用ln命令链接（link）它就可以，不必重复占用磁盘空间。

ln命令有两种链接方式：硬链接和软链接。硬链接是指通过索引节点来进行链接，而软链接则是建立一个特殊的文件来指向另外一个文件。硬链接只能对文件进行链接，而软链接可以对目录进行链接。
:::

```bash
# Create a symbolic link to a file or directory:
ln -s /path/to/file_or_directory path/to/symlink

# Overwrite an existing symbolic link to point to a different file:
ln -sf /path/to/new_file path/to/symlink

# Create a hard link to a file:
ln /path/to/file path/to/hardlink
```

## 文件对比、补丁
- `diff`


```bash
# Compare files (lists changes to turn `old_file` into `new_file`):
diff old_file new_file

# Compare files, ignoring white spaces:
diff --ignore-all-space old_file new_file

# Compare files, showing the differences side by side:
diff --side-by-side old_file new_file

# Compare files, showing the differences in unified format (as used by `git diff`):
diff --unified old_file new_file

# Compare directories recursively (shows names for differing files/directories as well as changes made to files):
diff --recursive old_directory new_directory

# Compare directories, only showing the names of files that differ:
diff --recursive --brief old_directory new_directory

# Create a patch file for Git from the differences of two text files, treating nonexistent files as empty:
diff --text --unified --new-file old_file new_file > diff.patch
```
- `patch`

```bash
# Execute commands from standard input (press `Ctrl + D` when done):
batch

# Execute a command from standard input:
echo "./make_db_backup.sh" | batch

# Execute commands from a given file:
batch -f path/to/file
```

### 文件查找
- `find`


```bash
# Find files by extension:
find root_path -name '*.ext'

# Find files matching multiple path/name patterns:
find root_path -path '**/path/**/*.ext' -or -name '*pattern*'

# Find directories matching a given name, in case-insensitive mode:
find root_path -type d -iname '*lib*'

# Find files matching a given pattern, excluding specific paths:
find root_path -name '*.py' -not -path '*/site-packages/*'

# Find files matching a given size range, limiting the recursive depth to "1"::
find root_path -maxdepth 1 -size +500k -size -10M

# Run a command for each file (use `{}` within the command to access the filename):
find root_path -name '*.ext' -exec wc -l {} \;

# Find files modified in the last 7 days:
find root_path -daystart -mtime -7

# Find empty (0 byte) files and delete them:
find root_path -type f -empty -delete
```
- `locate`


```bash
# Look for pattern in the database. Note: the database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily):

locate */filename

# Recompute the database. You need to do it if you want to find recently added files:
sudo updatedb
